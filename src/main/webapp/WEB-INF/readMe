 15.2. The DispatcherServlet
Spring's web MVC framework is, like many other web MVC frameworks, request-driven, designed
around a central servlet that dispatches requests to controllers and offers other functionality
 that facilitates the development of web applications.
  Spring's DispatcherServlet however, does more than just that.
   It is completely integrated with the Spring IoC container and as
    such allows you to use every other feature that Spring has.

    Upon initialization of a DispatcherServlet, the framework looks
    for a file named [servlet-name]-servlet.xml in the WEB-INF
    directory of your web application and creates the beans defined
    there, overriding the definitions of any beans defined with the
     same name in the global scope.
